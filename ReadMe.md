## Repositiory End-Goal Criterea
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
Make it a point to tackle new code, weekly (at least, periodaclly); and break it down.  Try to understand the concepts, yourself.  This only makes you more credible, and a stonger developer: because you've taken the tim to study!  Remember this also, as a developer, your goal should be designing NEW experiences that makes people's lives simple; because as developers, we solve problems that people didn't even knew they had- even better, in a way that they do not understand: We are the super heroes and heriones of tomorrow; so get coding, and I hope this repository helps you along your development.  Stay on task, Get Ahead, Change The World! - [Frederick Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/discoverfrederickthomas/), Super Coding Ninja‚Ñ¢
